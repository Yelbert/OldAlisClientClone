## Features

* Moderation commands
* Global emoji commands
* Complex embed commands
* Miscellaneous commands 
* Easy to make your own commands
* Community Cogs *(coming soon, join [our discord](https://discord.gg/pmQSbAd) for updates)*

If you want to request features, [create an issue](https://github.com/verixx/selfbot/issues) on this repo.


This is a `stateless selfbot` (Saves no data) *This means that you can [host it on heroku](https://github.com/verixx/selfbot/wiki/Heroku) 24/7 for free*  

## Community Cogs

**This is coming soon, so it's not working at the moment.**

To submit a cog, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/verixx/selfbot.py/pulls) into the [/cogs/community](https://github.com/verixx/selfbot.py/tree/rewrite/cogs/community) folder.        
To download a cog, add the Cog Name in `data/community_cogs.txt`. Invalid cog names will return an error in your console.

Currently available cogs:-    
* cog1
* cog2

Note: You **do not** have to add default cogs into `data/community_cogs.txt`.
